# CarHop

## Overview
CarHop is a carpooling app that benefits both drivers and passengers. Our goal was to create a unique carpooling experience, providing an affordable option for passengers, as well as an easy way for drivers to make some money off of trips they are already taking regularly. Overall, we believe CarHop provides a friendly UI experience that could scale to a legitimate carpooling app.

## Features
### Passenger Ride Request
Passengers request a ride by providing departure location, time of departure, and destination. The passenger also has the option to select a preference from a list of available drivers or remove their ride before the driverâ€™s acceptance. 
### Driver Search for Rides
Drivers can search for rides based on different criteria (e.g., departure and destination locations) and see available ride requests to accept. Available trips are shown on a map, with relevant information such as number of passengers, departure and destination locations, and fare included for each trip. 
### Passenger-Driver Chat
Allows text chatting once the driver accepts a ride and the driver and passenger are linked via a ride. This allows for seamless communication necessities such as confirming certain details and locating each other.
### App Usage Summary
Integrated an app usage summary, where both drivers and passengers can view their financial records (weekly, monthly and yearly) concerning how much money they have spent on the app or how much money they have made on the app. 
### Driver Search for Rides
Implemented a review system, where passengers can rate their driver based on their ride experience.
